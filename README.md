# Prayer Flick Overlay

A RuneLite plugin that provides a customizable prayer flicking overlay.

I tried to model it after the Quickprayer minimap orb and the prayer status bar from the StatusBars plugin.

Each prayer mode will behave like those other visual indicators do. Quickprayer will instantly toggle its icon, even if prayer hasn't been ticked on yet. StatusBar option will not show a change in prayer until it ticks on.

## Features

- Multiple motion styles for the tick indicator
  - Sine wave
  - Linear
  - Ease in/out
  - Ease out/in
  - Ping pong

- Vertical or horizontal orientation
- Reverse direction for the tick indicator
- Out of combat detection
- Customizable colors, sizing, icons
- The overlay is also movable and pinnable
